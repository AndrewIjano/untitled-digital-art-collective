## Summary
The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy—often in collective effort—the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming the limitations of software systems or electronic [[hardware]] (mostly digital electronics), to achieve novel and clever outcomes.

Hacker artists create art by hacking on technology as an artistic medium. This has extended the definition of the term and what it means to be a hacker. Such artists may work with graphics, computer hardware, sculpture, music and other audio, animation, video, software, simulations, mathematics, reactive sensory systems, text, poetry, literature, or any combination thereof. 

## Ideas
- A successful software and hardware hacker artist is Mark Lottor (mkl), who has created the 3-D light art projects entitled the [[cubratron]].
