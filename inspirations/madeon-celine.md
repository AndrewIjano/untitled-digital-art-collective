# Madeon - Celine

Celine, or 12122017, is an album released by Madeon - a french EDM/pop artist which goes breaks the artists' character by being an industrial techno album.

Madeon described it in the album's manifesto:

THIS IS AN ENTRY IN MY DIARY  
ON THE 12TH OF DECEMBER 2017 MUSIC MADE ME FEEL NOTHING  
I MADE SOME ANYWAY  
OUT OF ANGER 
FOR 24 HOURS  
IF ALBUMS TESTIFY ERAS  
THIS IS JUST A DAY

This album was **Secretly released through an [[ARG]]**. The full explanation is on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/madeon/comments/ikbinl/a_full_detailed_explanation_on_the_arg_and_how_we/), copied here for archival:

This vinyl was found off a strenuous and long ARG created by Madeon upon the release of "The Prince" official video. This post will detail the steps the Madeoncord has took to discover the 12122017 vinyl. Only 200 copies of this exist.

The first part of the ARG was found during ["Good Faith Radio Episode 5"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftbEhPowpLM). GFR 005 had 2 sets of audio steganography, morse code spelling out 12122017 and morse "THE PRINCE WILL LEAD TO CELINE". This was the first ever mention of "Celine".

Discoveries in "The Prince" video

1. Upon the release of ["The Prince" official video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOhFzDN3eMI), at 1:30 into the video, a series of letters and numbers flashed by the screen. By plugging these series of letters and numbers as a Youtube URL, it led to an unlisted video called ["twelvetwelvetwentyseventeen"](https://youtu.be/trLGj6HrrWU).
    
2. There is ASCII art of Hugo listed in the video description. A picture is created when plotting 1's as white and 0's as black. A converted image is found [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/582708408902221825/744078723753574470/unknown.png). We will return to this soon.
    

The first frame of the video read "@ 12122017" This lead to an Instagram account ["twelvetwelvetwentyseventeen".](https://www.instagram.com/twelvetwelvetwentyseventeen) There is a significant amount of information to unpack from this instragram account.

There are 6 posts that have 2 pictures each. 6 runes (too complicated but imagine it as Madeon's Rossetta Stone that nobody can decipher clearly) and part of a key, each with several numbers in their description. These numbers create a nonogram puzzle, and by completing the puzzle creates the [following image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/582708408902221825/744078058738417754/unknown.png).

PRINCE HD BUNDLE TRACK

[Madeon released The Prince HD single on his own store](https://madeon.store/collections/home-page/products/the-prince-hd-bundle). The base 64 link says "theprincewillleadtoceline". But that's not all, a clue was hidden in the acapella.

Viewing the audio spectogram of the Acapella and zooming out to the inaudible 48khz range, new Imperial font spells "THE PRINCE WILL LEAD TO CELINE". Inside "WILL LEAD TO" is a [maze.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/584826300548775976/743706621749886996/image0.png)

When completing the maze. It reads ["PULLED OUT OF THIN HEIR".](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/584826300548775976/743706704566288514/image0.png)

Twitter accounts

A twitter account is found related to the ARG: [@celine12122017](https://twitter.com/celine12122017?s=09)

On 8/13, an image was posted with one description, @x3.

[The same image was found in the vinyl.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/582708408902221825/722195948977258656/image0.png) But the square was covering up an imperial (Madeon's Alphabet) translation of "MRSL" This led to a twitter account [@MRSLMRSLMRSL](https://twitter.com/MRSLMRSLMRSL?s=09).

A single post was found with the description "IG VIA PERPTUA LUX". [By changing to the instagram eternal light filter, the text displays ITSAROTATINGDOTWORLD.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/582708408902221825/743807538528649316/image0.png?width=278&height=601) [This is a new URL.](http://itsarotating.world/)

Every 8 seconds, the website displays a new set of 8 numbers appear:

00090801 04201502 12050504 15212020 08051805 04061518 15140504 01250000

Separating these 8 numbers into sets of 2 digits and converting these to alphabet characters using an A1Z26 cipher, a sentence is revealed: I HAD TO BLEED OUT THE RED FOR ONE DAY

---

EVERYTHING CONNECTS

When converting the second row of the completed image to morse code, the translated created the string "FLIPNANOGRAMBIT".

[The overlayed nonogram creates The Architects logo horizontally flipped.](https://media.milanote.com/p/images/1K70mL1oYZSJ8D/vzl/1K70mL1oYZSJ8D-RLtyR.gif) When flipping "thearchitects.fr" to "stcetihcraeht.fr", a new web address is found. Similar to thearchitects.fr, there is a hidden input box above the logo. Unlike it's predecessor, this input requires pressing Enter and only appears to respond to one password.

Using the text found by completing the maze in the Acapella audio spectogram, PULLEDOUTOFTHINHEIR, the prompt changes to a numeric input: [00:00:00:00](https://i.gyazo.com/f67ae2e6d93080d7f556256b96d204b2.png).

Typing any of the 8 digit values from [http://itsarotating.world](http://itsarotating.world) while the number appears on [http://itsarotating.world](http://itsarotating.world), creates a countdown to Friday, August 21, 2020 1:00 AM CST

Think of this website as a "two-step authenticator" with itsarotating.world being your authenticator.

---

The countdown ended on August 21 midnight PST. A website appeared.

A series of panoramic images from Google Maps begins rotating every 12 minutes with a red filter. These locations appear to be centered on four points in Los Angeles, New York, Alesund, and Nantes. It took _17 HOURS_ until these images looped. There was a total of 85 images. (The Madeoncord stayed up during all of this).

After the 17th hour (image 85), the images began to repeat in their rotation.

[This document has all of the locations.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/137M6Il2MvC3qTbR82_nPKpxHwAunt7u3FTNO7HNyD1A/edit?usp=sharing)

(Off track) [One of the images was inside a fabric store in Los Angeles. The red was removed to examine the image better.](https://i.gyazo.com/146705e2f1e0ac3e692913d13523fa22.png) It was the very last location not found and it took the entire Madeoncord to find the location. [A document was made to check every single fabric store in LA.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15rzd1EG1m5PMN7XpyEx_Qv3DPX0xKuF812qumzHco9M/edit?usp=sharing) It was eventually found. Credit to Shmuel.

Upon mapping all the coordinates of the 85 images. Imperial letters spelled out in every city. [LA had HO, NYC had MI, Nantes had CI, and Alesund had DE.](https://imgur.com/a/G4g1Drn) It spelled out HOMICIDE.

On 8/25, typing in HOMICIDE as a password in stcetihcrAehT.fr, a new page is found. Two discoveries were made.

The passwords - [http://stcetihcraeht.fr/sixpasswords/](http://stcetihcraeht.fr/sixpasswords/)

08/25/20 - A new website is found appended to the stcetihcraeht.fr page.

6 inputs allow for different lengths of words, as defined by the page source:

"track1" maxlength="4" = HEIR

"track2" maxlength="8" = HOMICIDE

"track3" maxlength="13" = TURBOMEGAFAST

"track4" maxlength="6" = CELINE

"track5" maxlength="5" = ?????

"track6" maxlength="6" = ??????

The vinyl - [http://stcetihcraeht.fr/ELEVENX3/](http://stcetihcraeht.fr/ELEVENX3/)

A new website was found that contained a rotating image called ELEVENX3.png.

Several deductions were made.

1. The endgame is an EP. This was deducted by the source code on the passwords site. The source code had "trackX" corresponding with the 6. We were finding track names.
    
2. To find the next step, we had to figure out what came from the vinyl rotating image.
    
3. ELEVENX3 meant 11*3 which equals 33RPM.
    

The madeoncord built a literal virtual vinyl player. It was discovered by flattening the vinyl, there were readable sequential lines. The red and blue hues created two "channels."

Once the program was created, morse code was found. [https://media.milanote.com/p/files/1KaDJa1gfqwW3F/rL7/red_44100Hz.mp3](https://media.milanote.com/p/files/1KaDJa1gfqwW3F/rL7/red_44100Hz.mp3) (IT'S LOUD AND HIGH FREQ SO COVER YOUR EARS) This morse decoded to TURBOMEGAFAST

[A new website was found off this information.](http://stcetihcraeht.fr/turbomegafast/) It displayed a counter counting to August 28th midnight PST.

---

TURBOMEGAFAST displayed "BUILT TO GOOD FAITH" with every single letter (including the space) linking to 10 different PDFS of papercraft.

It was meant that _1 person_ needed to build every single papercraft. [What the completed one looks like.] ([https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/582708408902221825/749117977319833630/IMG_20200828_224900.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/582708408902221825/749117977319833630/IMG_20200828_224900.jpg)) Here is [Another view.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/582708408902221825/749117977814892595/IMG_20200828_225304.jpg)

The Madeoncord built a 3D model. When assembling the bases together, it fit into a perfect rectangle. Upon viewing the craft from top-down. It spelled out ABSOLU. [This is what the original looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/N8xSH73.png) [This is what the full craft looked like with clear letters.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/748824621293502555/748962781981704373/N8xSH73.png)

ABSOLU ended up being the 6TH PASSWORD on the password site.

Now all that was left was password 5. This is how that was found.

In 5 of the papercraft, there was an oddly placed rectangle with a letter presented next to it. The letters were A-B-C-D-E in imperial. [This is the infographic of those rectangles.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/748824621293502555/748858538998235226/unknown-38.png)

IF YOU PLACED the entire papercraft on top of the Vinyl, the rectangles correspond to a letter. When applying the ABCDE order, those letters spelled out POMME. [Infographic on this discovery](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/584826300548775976/749401030839631972/PAPERCRAFT.png?width=508&height=600)

All the passwords were found. They were all codes found within the ARG. HEIR HOMICIDE TURBOMEGAFAST CELINE POMME ABSOLU

In [https://12122017.world/password](https://12122017.world/password), by entering the password ONEDAYOFANGER, the store is unlocked to purchase the [CELINE 12" vinyl](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/ik6fnv). Only 200 was printed.

The vinyl contained 6 songs, all of them titled from the passwords. There is nothing on the B-side.

Congratulations to the Madeoncord, it was a collaborative effort with long nights, but we did it!
