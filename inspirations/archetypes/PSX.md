PSX is the future-retro aesthetic of Games in the PlayStation 1 and early PlayStation 2 era. The aesthetic started with games such as Gran Turismo, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Final Fantasy VII, and others.

The music of these games included some jazz and some rock, but most PSX era games included electronic music genres such as Jungle, Drum 'n' Bass and House.


The aesthetic was revisited in the 2020's by games such as [[signalis]] and by music producers such as nuphory and SAM WAITIN in a new genre called Rally House.
