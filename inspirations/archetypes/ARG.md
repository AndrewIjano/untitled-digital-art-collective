Augmented Reality Games (ARG) blend virtual game elements with the player's real-world environment. This allows the game to daze the player with the question with what is real or not.

Some examples of successful ARGs are:

- [[madeon-celine]], which had a treasure hunt ARG for an album release;
- [[cicada-3301]], which allegedly was a recruitment for smart minds.
