## Summary
The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis.

It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside the Matrix, a simulated reality created by intelligent machines. Believing computer [[hacker]] Neo to be "the One" prophesied to defeat them, Morpheus recruits him into a rebellion against the machines.

## Ideas
- The Matrix belongs to the [[cyberpunk]] genre of science fiction, and draws from earlier works in the genre such as the 1984 novel [[neuromancer]] by William Gibson.
- Influence from Japanese animation such as Ninja Scroll, Akira, [[ghost-in-the-shell]].
- The idea of a [[virtual-world]].
