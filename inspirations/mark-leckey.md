His works play around living in a big city (in his case, mostly about London) and a mix of hysteria and psychedelia.


## Ideas

Some annotations from @pedro823, not necessarily from his art, but of inspirations from going to his exposition:

- One way to create visual delirium is to repeat 3-5 different scenes with the same audio, but after a few repetitions, slowly change the scenes to something similar, with different sounds. "To the Old World (Thank You for the Use of Your Body)" (2021) is a perfect example of how to do it.

- Another way is to abruptly desync audio and video, especially during slow motion or in places such as danceclubs where the video is expected to be synced with audio.

- There's something really cool in how he shamelessly leaves technological artifacts in his art. For example, The aforementioned "To the Old World (Thank You for the Use of Your Body)" has clear use of interpolation between frames to slow the slow motion even more. But in that setting, it works amazingly well to create more anxiety and delirium.

- Another really interesting point is the use of day-to-day liminal objects and software, such as virtual billboards, park benches, street lamps, neon signs, google maps, advertisement software, etc.
