# Ace Combat Briefings

Ace Combat is a game series about combat planes. Ever since Ace Combat 4 (2001, PS2), the Ace Combat Series tells stories from a similar world to Earth, called "Strangereal". Due to its commitment of being purposedly detached to reality and due to the games being about military operations, technology does not need to look too realistic, allowing mission briefings to look extremely artistic.

## Ideas

- Much like [[signalis]], there's the idea using computerized HUD elements on top of maps, videos, images, real life.
