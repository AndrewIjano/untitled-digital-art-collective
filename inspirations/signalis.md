# Signalis

Signalis is an Indie horror game from rose-engine, 2022. The game plays around the notion of dreams, nightmares, deliria and human-machine interactions. You play as Elster, a humanoid robot - a very interesting creative decision as your HUD is introduced like it is part of your software, and glitches are somewhat tied to the player's health.

## Ideas

- [[PSX]] style post-processing
- Use of glitch inserts in interactive media and video (for example, timestamp 0:59 of mentioned video)
- Sound effects of older technology (radio, telephone) even though humanity is theoretically in a very technologically advanced society
