## Summary

**Serial Experiments Lain** is a 1998 Japanese anime series that explores the blurred boundaries between reality, identity, and digital consciousness in a hyperconnected world. It follows **Lain Iwakura**, a quiet teenage girl who becomes increasingly immersed in the **Wired** — a virtual network resembling the internet — after receiving an email from a classmate who had recently died.

## Ideas
### Themes
- **Reality vs. Virtuality**
    - The show questions the nature of reality in an age where digital communication alters perception.
    - The Wired becomes indistinguishable from the real world, suggesting that **reality is subjective and networked**.
        
- **Identity and Self**
    - Lain exists in multiple forms across the physical and digital realms, raising questions about **personal identity, multiplicity of self, and memory**.
    - Characters often ask: _"Who is Lain?"_ — echoing the instability of identity in digital life.
        
- **Technology and Consciousness**
    - The series explores how technology might evolve to **merge human consciousness with networks**.
    - References to computer science, philosophy, and neuroscience are frequent (e.g., the Knights of the Eastern Calculus, the Schumann resonance).
        
- **Isolation and Communication**
    - Despite being more connected, characters suffer from **alienation** and **disconnection**.
    - Lain herself becomes isolated as she becomes more entangled with the Wired.
        
- **God and the Network**
    - The idea of **a god emerging from collective digital consciousness** is central.
    - The Wired is portrayed not just as a tool, but as a **spiritual or metaphysical space**.

### Aesthetics
* **Visual Style:**
	* Dark, muted tones, minimalist backgrounds, and frequent use of shadow convey a sense of unease and isolation.
	* Static shots, glitch effects, and surreal transitions reflect mental fragmentation and digital distortion.
	* Technology resembles the [[y2k]]
* Cyberpunk and Psychological Horror:
	* A fusion of [[cyberpunk]], existentialism, and psychological horror, inspired by works like [[ghost-in-the-shell]] and Neon Genesis Evangelion, but more abstract and cerebral.
