## Summary
Virtual Self is the debut EP by the American electronic music producer [[porter-robinson]] under the alias Virtual Self. It is a trance and neotrance EP on which Robinson tried to recreate sounds from the early 2000s while incorporating modern song structures.

## Ideas
- It's rooted in [[nostalgia]]. Robinson wanted to help define how people remembered the [[early-2000s]], present in [[the-matrix]], forum signatures and rhythm game backgrounds.
- Cryptic messages and questions to create a mysterious atmosphere.
- Design trope in digital abstract art of the year 2000 "where people would put tiny text everywhereâ€”little floating sentences that are partially blurry and transparent. You feel like they're being whispered to you by a robot."
