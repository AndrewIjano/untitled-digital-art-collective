What happens when you have 8 artists to depict, interpret, and present unreal motion, a concept driven by a sneaker powered by 8 Air tubes?
The answer you could find at the Mugen Room in Tokyo on March 26. In this space where music, light, and energy intersected with art inspired by the Air Max Dn8, equipped with the latest air technology, unlocked new possibilities for expression.

Some of the artists are [[yoh-murata]], [[hayate-ito]] and [[ryota-kito]].
